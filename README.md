# gradebook-manager
A simple graphical user interface to record grades of students

The purpose of this application was to gain experience programming GUIs in Java.
It supports adding students, deleting selected students, saving the gradebook, and loading a saved gradebook. The gradebook is also sortable by clicking on the column headers.
Future improvements to this project would include adding and deleting assignments, grade calculation, and revision to the sorting and/or deleting functions.
